7.7 Exercises
1. No. Because the second function "proc(n)" is already defined.
2. Yes. It will return x = 7 and y = 6 
3. Yes. It will print 7
4. Yes. It will print 26
5. No. Because the function proc(x, y) has two arguments. However, in the main function, proc(5) only has one argument, no value for y.
6. No. Because the function proc(x) has only one argument. However, in the main function, proc(5, 4) has two arguments.
7. Yes. It will print 50.
8. It will print 10 instead. The reason is that the proc(num) returned value is not assigned to a variable and the variable num still has value 10.
   Then when print(num), it prints out num's value 10.
9. It is legal. Because x is a local variable. This means that I can name a local variable without 
   concern that its name may be used already in another part of the program.
10. It is legal. Because x and y are local variables. They will have no influence with each other.
